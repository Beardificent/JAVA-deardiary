#### Skeleton of a note-taking application

<p>This project pulled together everything I had learned so far about starting and configuring a project all the way through to using the text and design editor and running our app on an AVD!

<p>The Android Studio wizard created a project for my app, configured to my specifications. It created an empty activity and layout with a default template code. The activity controls what the app does and how it responds to the user. The layout specifies what the app looks like. Through the text and design editor, I was able to customize my app. I was able to preview my app on any Android device using an AVD. Finally, I used loggingâ€”an essential tool for debugging and developing applications. </p>
